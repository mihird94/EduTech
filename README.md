# EduTech

As technology is now shaping the future of education, educational mining is a novel emerging field which
concerns with developing algorithms to gather, analyze and discover hidden patterns in the educational data.
There is a tremendous increase in the number of educational institutions adopting e-learning systems to
leverage technology in classrooms. This streamlines the collection of educational data for analysis.
A kaggle dataset on student academic performance (available through https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/
xAPI-Edu-Data and also included as the attachment in this instruction) is gathered to identify the influential
factors for students’ performance. To predict the students’ performance, the collected data was organized into
four kinds of features: demographic, academic background, parents’ participation on learning process and
behavioral features. The demographic features consisted of demographic details of the students like gender,
nationality, place of birth etc. The section, grades and semester details of the students were included under
the academic features and behavioral features consisted of fields demonstrating students’ engagement with
the learning management system like viewed announcements, interaction with discussion groups, resources etc.
To analyze the students’ performance, the target “Class” attribute was discretized into orindal values based
upon students’ grades. Hence, we had three categories of student classes: **High/H, Low/L and Medium/M.**

**Techniques Used:-**
***1. Ordered Logistic Regresison***
***2. Artificial neural Network(using Keras for R***
***3. Random Forest Classifier***
***4. Principal Component Analysis***

**Classification Validation Accuracies Achieved:-**

1. Logistic Regression:- 72.03%
2. artificial Neural Network:- 76.92%
3. Random Forest Classifier:-  76.92% 
   random guess Baseline:- 33.33%
